# JSL03 Challenge – Solution Code

## Overview

This project involves creating a simple task management system where users can add up to three new tasks to an existing task array. Tasks are stored as objects in an array, each with a unique incremental ID. Users will enter task details via prompts, and the system will allow filtering to view only completed tasks. The project focuses on array manipulation, user interaction via prompts and alerts, and console logging for task management.

## Technology Used

- ✅ Interactive JavaScript
- 🧠 Browser Console - Used to display tasks
- 💬 Git and Github - For version control and sharing the project.

## Features

The project includes:

- ✅ Interactive JavaScript to collect and validate user input
- 🧠 Clear loops for input validation
- 🔍Validation of inputs to allow only todo, doing and done
- 💬 Automation of the filtration for completed tasks.

## Set Up

1. Clone the solution respository.
2. Ensure that the HTML and JS files are linked.

## How it works

- A maximum of three new tasks can be added per session.
- If the board reaches the maximum number of tasks - 11 for this setup - the loop stops.
- All completed tasks are displayed in the console using console.table.
